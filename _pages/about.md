Iâ€™m a self-motivated bioinformatician and aspiring data scientist, experienced in scientific Python and R programming. I have worked on cancer and rare Mendelian disease genomics, biomarker operations, and data infrastructure. I specialize in the analysis, structure, and wrangling of biological data, especially from next-generation sequencing experiments to find differentially expressed genes. As I enjoy working on projects together, please feel free to reach out for collaboration! 

Please be patient as this website is currently under construction. In the meantime, please see my Github and LinkedIn profile to learn more about me.

Thank you,

James

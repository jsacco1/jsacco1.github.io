Iâ€™m a self-motivated bioinformatician and data scientist, experienced in scientific Python and R programming. I have worked on cancer and rare Mendelian disease genomics, biomarker operations, and data infrastructure. I have hands-on experience with next-generation sequencing experiments, specifically RNA-Seq, and differential gene expression analysis. As I enjoy working on projects together, please feel free to reach out for collaboration! 

Please be patient as this website is currently under construction. In the meantime, please see my Github and [resume](/file:///C:/Users/james/AppData/Local/Temp/Temp1_James_Sacco_resume.zip/f10564d4-79c7-11ec-a980-0cc47a792c0a_id_f10564d4-79c7-11ec-a980-0cc47a792c0a.html) to learn more about me.

Thank you,

James

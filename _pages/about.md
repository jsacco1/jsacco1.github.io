Welcome to my page!

Iâ€™m a San Francisco-based bioinformatics scientist, with a background that includes collaboration on clinical trials for cancer immunotherapy (inaccurately called "cancer vaccines") and gene therapies for rare disorders. I am most experienced in Python, Linux, and R programming, especially in support of CRISPR gene editing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis. Out of all the NGS assays, I most enjoy working with transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data, and have gained extensive experience in several workflows, including: read mapping, variant calling, differential gene expression, gene set enrichment, pairwise and multiple sequence alignment, genomic variant annotation, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Several bioinformatics toolkits have aided my analyses, including BEDtools, BLAST, BWA, Galaxy, GATK, Hail, SAMtools, and BEDtools. 

As I work on CRISPR experiments, I have become familiar with the state-of-the-art on/off-target computational tools. In collaboration with bench scientists (mainly molecular biologists), I have extended these tools into custom analysis pipelines with their own user interfaces. I enjoy learning about and teaching these technologies to others. I care deeply about scientific rigor, experimental reproducibility, and open source bioinformatics projects. In my spare time, however, I enjoy classical music, good books, ultimate frisbee, and exploring the natural beauty of the Bay Area.

As I enjoy working on projects together, please feel free to reach out for collaboration! 

Thank you,

James

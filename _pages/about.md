Welcome to my page!

Iâ€™m a San Francisco-based bioinformatics scientist, experienced in Python and R programming, especially in support of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and CRISPR gene editing experiments. I most enjoy working on RNA-Seq data, and am proficient in several workflows: differential gene expression, gene set enrichment, and genomic variant annotation. I have supported clinical trials for cancer immunotherapy (inaccurately called "cancer vaccines") and gene therapy, and insights into biomarker operations. 

As I enjoy working on projects together, please feel free to reach out for collaboration! 

Thank you,

James

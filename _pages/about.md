Welcome to my page!

Iâ€™m a San Francisco-based bioinformatics scientist, experienced in Python and R programming, especially in support of CRISPR gene editing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis. I most enjoy working on high-throughput transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data. I am proficient in several workflows, including: differential gene expression, gene set enrichment, sequence alignment, and genomic variant annotation. I have supported clinical trials for cancer immunotherapy (inaccurately called "cancer vaccines") and gene therapy, and insights into biomarker operations. In my spare time, I enjoy classical music, good books, ultimate frisbee, and exploring the Bay Area.

As I enjoy working on projects together, please feel free to reach out to collaborate! 

Thank you,

James

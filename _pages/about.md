Iâ€™m a self-motivated bioinformatician and aspiring data scientist, experienced in scientific Python and R programming. I have worked on cancer and rare Mendelian disease genomics, biomarker operations, and data infrastructure. I specialize in the analysis and structure of genomics data, especially next-generation sequencing. As I enjoy working on projects together, please feel free to reach out to me for collaboration!

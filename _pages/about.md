Welcome to my page!

I am a San Francisco-based bioinformatics scientist specializing in CRISPR gene editing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis. My career has spanned collaborations on cancer immunotherapy trials and pioneering gene therapies for rare disorders. Key skills include Python, Linux, and R programming, with a focus on single-cell data analysis and custom pipeline development.

I excel in refining functional genomics experiments through in-depth on- and off-target editing analysis. My expertise extends to managing diverse projects, fostering team collaboration, and promoting scientific rigor and experimental reproducibility. Notable achievements include:

 - Designing genome-wide guide libraries for CRISPR gene silencing and activation (CRISPRi/a) with Cas9 and Cas12a in human cell lines.

 - Streamlining CRISPR experiments through comparative sensitivity studies of off-target editing analysis tools.
 
 - Collaborating with molecular biologists to develop custom analysis pipelines, enhancing data interpretation and accessibility.
 
 - Prototyping an in-house population genetic database with high-performance computing (HPC) and distributed systems that can ingest, store, and retrieve large-scale genomic datasets (e.g. GWAS)
 
 - Advocating for diversity and inclusion within scientific teams and contributing to open-source bioinformatics projects.

Outside of work, I enjoy classical music, literature, and outdoor activities in the Bay Area.

I am open to exciting collaborations and opportunities that align with my passion for advancing bioinformatics research and promoting inclusivity.

Thank you,

James

Iâ€™m a self-motivated bioinformatician and data scientist, experienced in scientific Python and R programming, especially in support of next-generation sequencing and CRISPR gene editing experiments. I most enjoy working on RNA-Seq data, and am proficient in differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analyses, as well as genomic variant annotation. I have supported clinical trials on cancer immunotherapy and rare Mendelian disease genomics, enhanced biomarker operations, and constructed pipelines/workflows. As I enjoy working on projects together, please feel free to reach out for collaboration! 

Please be patient as this website is currently under construction.

Thank you,

James

Welcome to my page!

Iâ€™m a San Francisco-based bioinformatics scientist, experienced in Python and R programming, especially in support of CRISPR gene editing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis. I most enjoy working on high-throughput transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data. I am proficient in several workflows, including: read mapping, variant calling, differential gene expression, gene set enrichment, pairwise and multiple sequence alignment, and genomic variant annotation. Several toolkits have aided my analyses, including Galaxy, GATK, SAMtools, BEDtools, and NCBI's BLAST. As I work on CRISPR experiments, I have become familiar with the state-of-the-art on/off-target computational tools. I am most proficient in Python, R, and LINUX shell scripting, and enjoy learning about and teaching these technologies to others. I care deeply about scientific rigor, experimental reproducibility, and open source projects. I have supported clinical trials for cancer immunotherapy (inaccurately called "cancer vaccines") and gene therapy, and insights into biomarker operations. In my spare time, I enjoy classical music, good books, ultimate frisbee, and exploring the Bay Area.

As I enjoy working on projects together, please feel free to reach out for collaboration! 

Thank you,

James

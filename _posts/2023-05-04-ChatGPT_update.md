# My experience with ChatGPT has been nothing but incredible

I have been using ChatGPT consistently for four days to help me with my work projects. As someone peripheral to the field of AI, 
I had my misgivings about these large language models (LLMs), with ChatGPT arguably the most popular in the media. 

I read a Wikihow article on how to use it to code, and never looked back. The first thing that really awe-struck me was when it
unexpectedly wrote me a bash script, but instead of pure bash commands, it was fully written in Perl! It's not important that the 
script took, I don't know, 8 hours to run. The thing is this code was easy to follow, neatly organized, and did what I wanted.

Today I have spent hours fine-tuning tasks that I had been putting off for months. It's like having a personal guru to talk to. 
I'm no longer frantically and/or hopelessly browsing StackOverflow or Biostars in the hopes that my question has been asked 
(and answered!) already. Even with answered questions, especially on Biostars, some of them are over ten years old--not
to mention the erosion of time on dependencies and platforms! Who among us has never had to download Bowtie version 1? How many
of my browser bookmarks are of old StackOverflow questions? I tremble at the thought.

I wrote a bash script that auto-generates a directory, with a README file, designed for a single-cell python module with its own
conda environment. And that README was beautiful. It even included a section for example usages and references.

The point is that I feel confident that LLMs are not here to take my job. The results of ChatGPT are not perfect. The technology 
will improve. For now, I have the domain knowledge and the wisdom that the model does not. I can say that I work much more 
efficiently. And for that, LLMs have been a godsend.
